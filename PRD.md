  - This is a sophisticated materials engineering platform requiring AI simulations, multi-objective optimization, material databases, property predictions, and progressive web app capabilities with offline sync

## Essential Features

### Interactive Periodic Table Selector
- **Functionality**: Visual periodic table interface for element selection with click-to-add composition building
- **Purpose**: Primary input mechanism for custom material creation; makes complex chemistry accessible
- **Trigger**: User clicks "New Material" or starts from periodic table view
- **Progression**: View periodic table → Click elements to add → Adjust composition ratios → See compatibility warnings → Proceed to simulation
- **Success criteria**: Users can select multiple elements, see real-time composition percentages, receive element compatibility feedback

### Material Database Browser
- **Functionality**: Searchable/filterable database of real-world materials organized by category (metals, polymers, ceramics, composites, semiconductors)
- **Purpose**: Enable users to start from known materials rather than building from scratch; provides reference data
- **Trigger**: User clicks "Browse Materials" or searches in material library
- **Progression**: Browse/search materials → Filter by category/properties → Select material → View composition/properties → Clone and modify or use as baseline
- **Success criteria**: Fast search results, accurate material data display, ability to modify and save variations

### AI Property Prediction Engine
- **Functionality**: Predicts mechanical (tensile strength, elasticity, hardness), electrical (conductivity, resistivity, dielectric constant), and chemical properties (corrosion resistance, reactivity, stability)
- **Purpose**: Core value proposition - instantly predict material behavior without expensive lab testing
- **Trigger**: User completes material composition and clicks "Simulate Properties"
- **Progression**: Input composition → Select environmental conditions (temp, pressure, humidity) → Run AI simulation → Display predicted properties with confidence scores → Show property comparison charts
- **Success criteria**: Predictions complete within 2-3 seconds, results shown with confidence intervals, clear visualization of property ranges

### Multi-Objective Optimization
- **Functionality**: Balance competing objectives (cost, performance, sustainability, availability, weight) to generate optimal material recommendations
- **Purpose**: Help users make practical decisions considering real-world constraints beyond pure performance
- **Trigger**: User defines target properties and constraints, clicks "Optimize"
- **Progression**: Set target properties → Define constraints (max cost, sustainability requirements) → Weight objectives → Run optimization → View Pareto frontier → Select from ranked recommendations
- **Success criteria**: Generate 5-10 viable alternatives, show trade-off visualizations, enable comparison of solutions

### Material Builder Workspace
- **Functionality**: Central workspace showing composition ratios, processing parameters, property predictions, and microstructure visualizations
- **Purpose**: Unified view of all material data; primary workspace for iterative design
- **Trigger**: User creates or opens a material
- **Progression**: View composition → Adjust ratios with sliders → Modify processing (temperature, time, pressure) → See real-time property updates → Save/export material specification
- **Success criteria**: Real-time updates as parameters change, clear visualization of composition, ability to save multiple design iterations

## Edge Case Handling

- **Invalid Compositions**: Warn when element combinations are chemically unstable or impractical (e.g., noble gas compounds)
- **Extreme Conditions**: Show warning when simulating outside typical parameter ranges with reduced confidence scores
- **No Results Found**: Provide alternative search suggestions and option to create custom material from scratch
- **Optimization Infeasibility**: Clearly communicate when constraints are impossible to satisfy; suggest relaxing specific constraints
- **Offline Mode**: Queue simulations for when connection returns; show cached results from previous sessions
- **Complex Compositions**: Limit to 10 elements to maintain computational feasibility; suggest simplification for >10 element alloys

## Design Direction

The interface should evoke the feeling of a high-tech laboratory workbench - clean, precise, and scientific with a touch of futurism. Think aerospace engineering software meets modern web design. The aesthetic should be professional and trustworthy (this is used for serious engineering decisions) while remaining approachable for students and researchers. Use a rich interface with data visualization, charts, and interactive 3D models where appropriate to communicate complex material properties.

## Color Selection

Custom palette - A scientific/technical color scheme that communicates precision and innovation

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (#2563EB / oklch(0.55 0.20 265)) - Represents trust, precision, and scientific rigor; used for primary actions and key data points
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Slate Gray (#475569 / oklch(0.42 0.02 260)) for secondary UI elements and data tables
  - Teal Accent (#0D9488 / oklch(0.58 0.13 185)) for success states and optimized solutions
- **Accent Color**: Electric Purple (#8B5CF6 / oklch(0.60 0.21 295)) - Used for AI predictions, simulation results, and highlighting intelligent features
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (White #FFFFFF / oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Gray text (#1E293B / oklch(0.25 0.02 260)) - Ratio 14.2:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Gray #F8FAFC / oklch(0.99 0 0)): Dark Gray text (#1E293B) - Ratio 13.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue #2563EB): White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 5.9:1 ✓
  - Secondary (Slate Gray #475569): White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 6.2:1 ✓

## Font Selection

The typeface should convey technical precision while maintaining excellent readability for complex data tables and numerical values. Use Inter for its exceptional clarity at all sizes and tabular number support.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Main Title): Inter Bold / 32px / -0.02em letter spacing / 38px line height
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold / 24px / -0.01em letter spacing / 32px line height
