# Material Composition Recommendations - Feature Overview

## New Features Added

### 1. AI-Powered Composition Recommendations Panel
**Location**: Appears after property simulation for element-based materials  
**Purpose**: Provides intelligent suggestions to improve material composition

**Key Capabilities**:
- Generates 3-5 specific composition recommendations based on simulated properties
- Each recommendation includes:
  - **Name**: Descriptive title for the suggestion
  - **Composition**: Complete element breakdown with percentages
  - **Category**: Type of improvement (strength enhancement, conductivity, cost optimization, etc.)
  - **Rationale**: Scientific explanation of why the change works
  - **Expected Improvements**: Specific property enhancements
  - **Trade-offs**: Potential downsides to consider
  - **Impact Level**: High/medium/low indicator
- One-click application of suggested compositions
- Color-coded by impact level (high impact = green, medium = purple, low = gray)

**User Flow**:
1. Simulate material properties
2. Click "Get Recommendations" button
3. Review AI-generated suggestions with detailed explanations
4. Click "Apply This Composition" on preferred suggestion
5. Composition automatically updates (properties reset for re-simulation)

### 2. Property Target Search Dialog
**Location**: Header toolbar ("Find by Property" button)  
**Purpose**: Reverse engineering - find materials that meet specific property targets

**Key Capabilities**:
- Select property category (Mechanical/Electrical/Chemical)
- Choose specific property from dropdown
- Enter target value with appropriate units
- Generates 3 material composition suggestions that achieve the target
- Each suggestion shows full composition, rationale, and key properties
- Direct application to current workspace

**User Flow**:
1. Click "Find by Property" in header
2. Select property type (e.g., Mechanical â†’ Tensile Strength)
3. Enter target value (e.g., 500 MPa)
4. Click "Find Materials"
5. Review suggestions with compositions and explanations
6. Apply chosen composition to workspace

**Example Use Cases**:
- "I need a material with electrical conductivity > 50 MS/m"
- "Find materials with corrosion resistance > 85"
- "What compositions achieve Young's modulus of 200 GPa?"

### 3. Composition Analysis & Quick Fixes
**Location**: Appears alongside recommendations panel after property simulation  
**Purpose**: Identify composition issues and provide targeted micro-adjustments

**Key Capabilities**:
- Analyzes current composition against predicted properties
- Identifies issues (incompatibilities, poor ratios, processing challenges)
- Suggests specific modifications:
  - **Add**: Introduce new element at specific percentage
  - **Remove**: Eliminate problematic element
  - **Increase**: Boost existing element percentage
  - **Decrease**: Reduce existing element percentage
- Each suggestion includes:
  - Modification type with visual indicator
  - Amount of change (percentage points)
  - Scientific reasoning
  - Expected property effect
- One-click application with automatic normalization to 100%

**User Flow**:
1. Simulate properties for a composition
2. Click "Analyze Composition"
3. Review identified issues (if any)
4. Browse quick improvement suggestions
5. Click "Apply This Change" on individual modifications
6. Composition updates with normalization

## Technical Implementation

### New Library File: `recommendations.ts`
Located at: `/src/lib/recommendations.ts`

**Exported Functions**:
1. `generateRecommendations(targetProperties, currentComposition)`
   - Main recommendation engine
   - Returns array of MaterialRecommendation objects

2. `suggestCompositionForTarget(propertyTarget)`
   - Property-based material search
   - Takes property type, name, value, unit
   - Returns composition suggestions

3. `analyzeCompositionIssues(composition, properties)`
   - Composition analysis engine
   - Returns issues array and suggestions array
   - Suggestions include modification type and details

**Data Structures**:
```typescript
interface MaterialRecommendation {
  name: string
  composition: Composition
  category: string
  rationale: string
  expectedImprovements: string[]
  tradeoffs?: string[]
  impact: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
}

interface CompositionModification {
  type: 'add' | 'remove' | 'increase' | 'decrease'
  element: string
  amount: number
  reason: string
  expectedEffect: string
}
```

### New Components

1. **RecommendationPanel.tsx**
   - Main recommendations UI
   - Handles recommendation generation and application
   - Visual styling by impact level

2. **PropertyTargetDialog.tsx**
   - Modal dialog for property-based search
   - Property selection with categories
   - Target value input with units

3. **CompositionAnalysis.tsx**
   - Analysis UI with issues and suggestions
   - Modification application logic
   - Automatic composition normalization

---

## Integration Points

### App.tsx Changes
1. Added new imports for all three components
2. Created `handleApplyRecommendation` function to update composition
3. Added PropertyTargetDialog to header toolbar
4. Placed CompositionAnalysis and RecommendationPanel in 2-column grid below properties
5. Only shows for element-based materials (not polymers yet)

### PRD Updates
Added three new essential features to the PRD:
- AI-Powered Composition Recommendations
- Property-Based Material Search
- Composition Analysis & Quick Fixes

---

## Design Decisions

### Why Two Separate Recommendation Approaches?
1. **RecommendationPanel**: Iterative improvement on existing composition
2. **PropertyTargetDialog**: Goal-oriented from scratch (clean slate approach)

### Why Separate Analysis from Recommendations?
- Analysis focuses on *problems* (diagnostic)
- Recommendations focus on *opportunities* (enhancement)
- Different user intents and mindsets

### Color Coding System
- **High Impact**: Success color (teal) - major improvements
- **Medium Impact**: Accent color (purple) - moderate gains
- **Low Impact**: Muted color (gray) - minor tweaks

### One-Click Application
- Removes friction from experimentation
- Users can quickly try suggestions
- Properties reset to force re-simulation (ensures accuracy)

---

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Polymer Recommendations**: Extend system to monomer-based polymers
2. **Comparison Mode**: Side-by-side comparison of multiple recommendations
3. **Recommendation History**: Track applied suggestions and results
4. **Export Reports**: PDF generation with recommendations and rationale
5. **Batch Analysis**: Compare multiple compositions simultaneously
6. **Learning System**: Improve recommendations based on user selections
7. **Cost Estimation**: Add material cost analysis to recommendations
8. **Processing Recommendations**: Suggest manufacturing parameters

## Usage Tips for Users

### Best Practices
1. Always simulate properties before requesting recommendations
2. Read the rationale - it contains valuable materials science insights
3. Consider trade-offs before applying high-impact changes
4. Use composition analysis for troubleshooting, recommendations for enhancement
5. Try property target search when starting from performance requirements
