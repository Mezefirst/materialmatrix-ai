An AI-powered web application for materials scientists, engineers, and researchers to design, simulate, and optimize novel materials through an intelligent interface.

## üöÄ Key Features

### Material Design
- **Interactive Periodic Table**: Visual element selection with click-to-add composition building
- **Polymer Development**: Combine monomers to design custom polymers with controlled properties
- **Material Database**: Browse and modify real-world materials from comprehensive database

### AI-Powered Analysis
- **Property Prediction**: Instantly predict mechanical, electrical, and chemical properties
- **Composition Recommendations**: Get intelligent suggestions to improve your material
- **Property Target Search**: Find materials that meet specific performance requirements
- **Quick Analysis**: Identify composition issues and get targeted improvements

### Optimization & Simulation
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Balance cost, performance, sustainability, and availability
- **Environmental Conditions**: Simulate properties under various temperature, humidity, and pressure
- **Thermal Analysis**: Predict glass transition, melting, and decomposition temperatures for polymers

## üéØ Quick Start Workflows

### Workflow 1: Design from Elements
1. Select elements from the periodic table
2. Adjust composition percentages
3. Set environmental conditions
4. Simulate properties
5. Get AI recommendations for improvements
6. Apply suggestions and re-simulate

### Workflow 2: Find by Property Target
1. Click "Find by Property" in header
2. Select property type (e.g., Tensile Strength)
3. Enter target value (e.g., 500 MPa)
4. Review AI-suggested compositions
5. Apply to workspace and verify

### Workflow 3: Polymer Design
1. Switch to "Polymers" tab
2. Select 1-5 monomers from library
3. Adjust mole fractions
4. Set polymer architecture
5. Simulate thermal and mechanical properties
6. Save polymer formulation
